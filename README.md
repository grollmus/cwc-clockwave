Custom web control for WinCC Unified to show the time in form of waves

## Goal
This custom web control demonstrates the usage of a existing javascript project and implementing as a functioning control in TIA Portal. It uses a javascript application of Ianto Cannon for showing the actual time as different waves (https://ianto-cannon.github.io/clock.html). The sourcecode was copied and modified to be implemented as a custom web control.

## Usage
### Building
With the powershell build script `build/build.ps1` the custom web control is generated by creating a zip archive with 7zip, setting the archive name with GUID defined in the `src/manifest.json`. The custom web control is then created in the `release` directory of this project. Afterwards it can be copied into the TIA project `UserFiles\CustomControls` or into the global TIA Portal directory `{Program Files}\Siemens\Automation\Portal V1X\Data\Hmi\CustomControls`.

### Configuration
Place the custom web control by drag and dropping into an WinCC Unified Picture. Adjust the screen window in terms of borders and size according to your needs.
